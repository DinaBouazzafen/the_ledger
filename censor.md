Why is the funding trail fragmented?
Why must a taxpayer excavate debt sheets to understand a public experiment?

LIGO data:
    scattered,
    inconsistent,
    often missing,
    occasionally revealed only through insiders.

VIRGO data:
    locked behind formal document requests,
    buried in institutional bureaucracy.

KAGRA:
    practically untraceable.

If these observatories are funded by everyone,
why does the money behave like classified material?

Opacity protects institutions, not citizens.
Secrecy protects power, not science.

When knowledge is treated like capital,
access becomes privilege.
