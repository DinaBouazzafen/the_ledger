>> 01_POLITICIZATION

Politicization begins when power quietly outranks expertise:
new appointees in key positions,
rules rewritten,
projects ended without explanation,
grants filtered by ideology instead of evidence.

As this grows, science shifts from inquiry to obedience.
Political staff review proposals they cannot judge.
Grants freeze “for convenience”.
Voices that don’t fit the story slide to the edges.

The results: worse choices, delayed research,
wasted public money,
and labs where speaking openly feels risky.

History has seen this before, 
regimes that rewarded false results and punished real ones.
Today the methods are softer,
but the pattern is uncomfortably familiar.
