## TECHNICAL APPENDIX (OUT-OF-BAND)

This project is intentionally minimal.

**Stack:**
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (layout, typography, effects)
- JavaScript (logic, state, interaction)
- jQuery (DOM manipulation & file loading)

No build step.  
No frameworks.  
No backend.

### Requirements

- A modern browser
- A local or hosted web server  
  (Markdown files will not load via `file://`)

### jQuery

You must include jQuery for the interface to function.

Example:

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>

Or download it locally and reference it:
<script src="./lib/jquery.min.js"></script>

### FINAL STATEMENT
This archive is not exhaustive.
It is representative.

Transparency is not binary.
It degrades.
