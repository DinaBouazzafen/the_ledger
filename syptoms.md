>> 01_POLITICIZATION

SYMPTOM SCAN: ACTIVE

01 — FUNDING DISTORTION
    Research priorities quietly realigned to match political optics.
    High-visibility projects favored over high-uncertainty inquiry.
    Long-term work abandoned for short-term narratives.

02 — ADMINISTRATIVE OVERRIDE
    Decision power shifts from subject-matter experts to managers.
    Review panels stacked with non-specialists.
    Appeals dismissed as “procedural”.

03 — LANGUAGE CONTROL
    Certain terms discouraged, redefined, or flagged as “problematic”.
    Proposals rewritten to sound compliant rather than accurate.
    Precision replaced with approved phrasing.

04 — DATA SUPPRESSION
    Results delayed, buried, or labeled “inconclusive” without cause.
    Negative findings quietly excluded from reports.
    Access restricted under vague security justifications.

05 — CAREER PRESSURE
    Promotions correlate with alignment, not rigor.
    Dissent reframed as instability or “lack of collegiality”.
    Silence becomes the safest professional strategy.

STATUS:
    These symptoms rarely appear alone.
    Once normalized, they self-reinforce.

SYSTEM NOTE:
    Politicization does not announce itself.
    It arrives disguised as efficiency, safety, and consensus.
